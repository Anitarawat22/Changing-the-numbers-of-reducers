BY default  we have a 1 reducer but we can change it to 0 or make it more than 1.

QUESTION -1 WHEN SHOULD WE CONSIDER TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REDUCERS.

CONSIDER A SCENERIO REDUCER HAS TO DO A LOT OF WORK THAN THE MAPPER AND YOU TRY YOUR BEST  THAT MAPPER DO MORE STILL A SINGLE REDUCER OVER BURDEN INTO DOING A LOT OF WORK.
You should increase the size of a reducer in distributed processing when the amount of data being processed by the reducer exceeds its capacity, causing performance degradation or resource bottlenecks.

QUESTION -2 WHEN WE SHOULD MAKE THE NU,BER OF REDUCERS TO 0?
when the reducer is 0 then the mapper output is the final output . In shuffling ans sorting only happens when we have 1 or more than 1 reducer.



Concept of partitionm comes when  we have more than  one reducer.
This is to tell which key value pair  goes to which reducer.

BY DEFAULT THERE IS A HASH FUNCTION.

CONSIDER YOU HAVE 3 REDUCER SO WHICH PARTITION WILL GO WHERE

3 REDUCERS -0,1,2

1%3 = 1
2%3 = 2
3%3 = 0
4%3 = 1
5%3 = 2
6%3 = 0


hash function is consistent

(HELLO ,1) REDUCER -1
(HI ,1) REDUCER -2
(HELLO ,1) REDUCER -1

same key should always go to same reducer .

IF your hash function is not consitent then  you will get the final answer.

question -3 What is shuffle ?

Sending the data from  mapper machine to reduce machine

question -4 what is sort?
operation done on reducer machine to get all the same keys together in a group.
